# âœ¨ Zack Davidson

I'm an indie developer based in Scotland, and I've been programming since I was 10. I build all my projects from the ground up, starting from the idea phase and going through to implementation, with a focus on solving real-world problems.



## ðŸ“± Technologies & Frameworks

I have accumalted a lot of knowledge through several years of practice. Please see below the list of my favourite languages, frameworks and tools to develop.
